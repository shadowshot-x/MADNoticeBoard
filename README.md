### Tech

Notice board uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [React JS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [Material UI] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
* [Mongoose] - Database handler
* [Axios] - duh

### Installation

This requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ cd MADNoticeBoard
$ cd board && npm install
